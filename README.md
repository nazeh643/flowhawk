## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

To get started with Flowhawk, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/nazeh643/flowhawk/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system and follow the installation instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Go programming language (version 1.16 or later)
- Access to a Linux environment with eBPF support
- Root privileges to run Flowhawk

### Steps to Install

1. **Download the Release**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/nazeh643/flowhawk/releases) section and download the latest version.
2. **Extract the Package**: Unzip the downloaded file.
3. **Build the Project**: Navigate to the directory and run the following command:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```
4. **Run Flowhawk**: Execute the binary with root privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo ./flowhawk
   ```

## Usage üìä

Once installed, you can start using Flowhawk to monitor your network. The following sections outline basic commands and configurations.

### Starting Flowhawk

To start monitoring, simply run:
```bash
sudo ./flowhawk start
```

### Configuration

Flowhawk allows for customizable settings. You can modify the configuration file located at `config.yaml`. Here are some key parameters:

- **alert_threshold**: Set the threshold for alerts.
- **monitoring_interfaces**: Specify which network interfaces to monitor.
- **logging_level**: Choose the verbosity of logs (info, debug, error).

### Viewing Results

After starting Flowhawk, you can access the dashboard via your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`. The dashboard provides real-time visualizations of network traffic, detected threats, and system performance.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Flowhawk is built on a robust architecture that leverages several key components:

- **eBPF Programs**: These programs run in the Linux kernel and filter packets efficiently.
- **Data Collection**: Flowhawk collects and processes network data in real-time.
- **Machine Learning Models**: AI algorithms analyze the data for threat detection.
- **User Interface**: A web-based dashboard displays insights and alerts.

### Data Flow

1. **Packet Capture**: eBPF captures packets at the kernel level.
2. **Data Processing**: Flowhawk processes the data using machine learning models.
3. **Alert Generation**: The system generates alerts based on detected anomalies.
4. **User Notification**: Users receive notifications through the dashboard.
